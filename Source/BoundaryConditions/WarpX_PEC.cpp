/**
 * \brief Sets the rho field value in cells close to and inside a PEC boundary.
 *        The charge density deposited in the guard cells are either reflected
 *        back into the simulation domain (if a reflecting particle
 *        boundary is used), or the opposite charge density is deposited
 *        back in the domain to capture the effect of an image charge.
 *        The charge density on the PEC boundary is set to 0 while values
 *        in the guard cells are set equal and opposite to their mirror
 *        location inside the domain - representing image charges.
