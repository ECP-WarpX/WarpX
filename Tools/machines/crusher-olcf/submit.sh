# From the documentation:
# Each Crusher compute node consists of [1x] 64-core AMD EPYC 7A53
# "Optimized 3rd Gen EPYC" CPU (with 2 hardware threads per physical core) with
# access to 512 GB of DDR4 memory.
# Each node also contains [4x] AMD MI250X, each with 2 Graphics Compute Dies
# (GCDs) for a total of 8 GCDs per node. The programmer can think of the 8 GCDs
# as 8 separate GPUs, each having 64 GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM2E).
