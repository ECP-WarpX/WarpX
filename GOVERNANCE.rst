WarpX Governance
================

WarpX is led in an open governance model, described in this file.


Steering Committee
------------------

Current Roster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Jean-Luc Vay (chair)
- Remi Lehe
- Axel Huebl

See: `GitHub team <https://github.com/orgs/ECP-WarpX/teams/warpx-admins>`__

Role
^^^^

The steering committee (SC) can change repo requirements, can do administrative operations such as rename/move/archive projects, etc.
SC members call votes for decisions.

The SC can veto decisions of the technical committee (TC) by voting in the SC.

The SC can change the governance structure, but only in an unanimous vote.

Decision Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decision are made in a public, majority vote of SC members.
In tie situations, the chair of the SC acts as the tie breaker.

Appointment Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Appointed by current SC members in an unanimous vote.

SC members can resign or be removed by majority vote, e.g., due to inactivity, bad acting or other reason.


Technical Committee
-------------------

Current Roster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Luca Fedeli
- Roelof Groenwald
- David Grote
- Axel Huebl
- Revathi Jambunathan
- Remi Lehe
- Andrew Myers
- Maxence Th√©venet
- Weiqun Zhang
- Edoardo Zoni

See: `GitHub team <https://github.com/orgs/ECP-WarpX/teams/warpx-push-merge-write>`__

Role
^^^^

The technical committee (TC) is the core governance body, where under normal operations most ideas are discussed and decisions are made.
Individual TC members can approve and merge code changes.
Usually, they seek approval by another maintainer for their own changes, too.
TC members lead and weight in on technical discussions and can call a vote between TC members, if needed for a technical decision.
TC members merge/close PRs and issues, and moderate (including block/mute) bad actors.
The TC can propose governance changes to the SC.


Decision Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Discussion on a topic in the weekly developer meetings.

If someone calls for a vote to make a decision: majority based on the passed votes; we need 50% of the committee participating to vote. In the absence of a quorum, the SC will decide.

Decision are made in a public, majority vote of TC members.

In the absence of a quorum (>50%) in the TC, the SC decides according to its voting rules.

TC members can individually highlight  new contributors, unless a vote is called on an individual.

Appointment Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TC members are the maintainers of WarpX.
As a TC member, regularly attending and contributing to the weekly developer meetings is expected.

One is appointed to the TC by the steering committee, in an unanimous vote.
Steering committee members can also be TC members.

TC members can resign or be removed by majority vote by either TC or SC, e.g., due to inactivity, bad acting or other reason.


Contributors
------------

Current Roster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See: `GitHub team <https://github.com/orgs/ECP-WarpX/teams/warpx-contributors>`__

Role
^^^^

Contributors are valuable, vetted developers to WarpX.
Contributions can be in many forms and not all need to be code contributions.
Examples include code pull requests, support in issues & user discussions, writing and updating documentation, R&D on novel numerics, testing and benchmarking, etc.
Contributors can participate in developer meetings and weight in on discussions.
Contributors can "triage" (add labels) to pull requests, issues, and GitHub discussion pages.
Contributors can comment and review PRs (but not merge).

Decision Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contributors can individually decide on classification (triage) of pull requests, issues, and GitHub discussion pages.

Appointment Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Appointed after contributing to WarpX (see above) by any member of the TC.

The role can be lost by resigning or majority vote by TC or SC due to inactivity, bad acting or other.


Former Members
--------------

"Former members" are the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
But, for the purpose of WarpX governance, they are *not* tracked as a governance role in WarpX.
Instead, former (e.g., inactive) contributors are acknowledged separately in GitHub contributor tracking, the WarpX documentation, references, citable Zenodo archives of releases, etc. as appropriate.

Former members of SC, TC and Contributors are not kept in the roster, since committee role rosters shall reflect currently active members and responsible governance body.
