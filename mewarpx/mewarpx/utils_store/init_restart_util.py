    Attempts to restart a run by looking for checkpoint files
    starting with a prefix in the given directory.

    Arguments:
        checkpoint_directory (string): Look in this directory for checkpoint
            directories. Default is ``diags``.
        checkpoint_prefix (string): Look for a checkpoint directory starting
            with this prefix to restart from.
        force (bool): If true, a problem with restarting from a checkpoint will
            cause an error, otherwise simply print a warning.
        additional_steps (int): The number of steps to run after restarting from
            the checkpoint. If this is None then it will run to the current
            value of mwxrun.simulation.max_steps.
