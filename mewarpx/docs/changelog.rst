CHANGELOG
=========

The main version number follows standard `Semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ practice.
The "Physics version" is updated when a change is made to a physical model implementation
such that running the same simulation with two different physics version number installations
will result in a different physics outcome for that simulation (change in measurable
quantity such as current density, plasma density, etc.).

The "List of changes" when updating a version number can generally include **Physics changes**,
**Features**, **API Changes**, **Other changes** and **Bugfixes**.
