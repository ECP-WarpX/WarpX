2.0.1, 0, In progress, "

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (release 21.11) into memaster.
"
2.0.0, 1, 11/04/2021, "

**API Changes**:

- Renamed `mepicmi` to `mespecies`.
- Removed ``V_anode`` as input argument to
  :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.init_timestep`.
- :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.init_grid` now accepts boundary conditions
  as input.
- :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.init_grid` input argument ``max_grid_size``
  has been renamed to the more appropriate ``min_tiles``, and the default value
  changed from 4 to 1.
- Removed argument `write_dir` from checkpoint diagnostic.
- Argument ``max_steps`` in :class:`mewarpx.sim_control.SimControl` was changed
  to ``total_steps``.

**Other changes**:

- :class:`mewarpx.emission.ThermionicInjector` will now use the temperature
  and work-function of the conductor if those values are not directly given.

**Bugfixes**:

- In :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.step` the value of
  ``self.simulation.max_steps`` is no longer used, but instead the function
  relies on ``sim_control`` entirely.
- When attempting to restart the simulation it will not restart from a
  checkpoint file dumped at step 0.

"
1.0.0, 1, 11/03/2021, "

**Physics changes**:

- The flux history will now be loaded when restarting a run from a checkpoint
  file, so that the ``fullhist_dict`` accurately reflects the flux recorded
  over the full simulation span.

**API Changes**:

- Removed argument `write_dir` from diagnostics. Instead class variables are
  used for each type of diagnostic to specify the directory where data and
  plot files will be saved.
- :class:`mewarpx.diags_store.flux_diagnostic.FluxDiagFromFile` no longer takes
  runinfo parameters as input since the pickle files saved
  by :func:`mewarpx.diags_store.flux_diagnostic.FluxDiagBase.save` now contain
  all the information needed to reconstruct the flux diagnostic from file.

**Other changes**:

- :class:`mewarpx.diags_store.flux_diagnostic.FluxDiagBase` now also saves the
  list of species names included in the simulation and a dictionary of
  components and their labels, in the flux diagnostic pickle file. This allows
  flux diagnostics to be reloaded without loading a runinfo file.

0.2.1, 0, 11/02/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (release 21.11) into memaster.
"
0.2.0, 0, 10/28/2021, "

**Features**:

- Allow multiple embedded boundaries to be installed in the simulation.

**Other changes**:

- The time-dependent voltage pulse function generated with
  :func:`mewarpx.util_store.pulsing.linear_pulse_function` was changed to no
  longer use variables in the expression. This is in order to be able to nest
  the voltage functions in ``if`` statements when multiple EBs are present.
"
0.1.1, 0,  10/26/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- :func:`mewarpx.utils_store.util.check_version` for scripts to define what
  version they use.
