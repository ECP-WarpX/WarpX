2.0.5, 2, In progress, "

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (git hash ``9e02b95``) into memaster.
"
2.0.4, 2, 11/23/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (git hash ``430c972``) into memaster.

**Bugfixes**:

- Fix bug in post-processing of field diagnostic ``yt`` data where the average
  values along axis 0 was plotted instead of the full data array.
"
2.0.3, 2, 11/18/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- Flux diagnostic data will be copied to checkpoint folders in order to ensure
  that the flux data loaded during a restart comes from the appropriate
  simulation step.
- The particles scraped on the first step after standard pre-seed plasma
  injection will no longer be counted by the flux diagnostic. Due to this change
  reference values for the ``test_two_embedded_cylinders_scraping`` test had to
  be updated.
- Merge ``upstream/development`` (git hash ``b0c2c42``) into memaster.

**Bugfixes**:

- Fix bug in reloading the full flux history from a restart where the value of
  ``history_dt`` was not properly set.
"
2.0.2, 2, 11/11/2021, "

**Physics changes**:

- :func:`mewarpx.util_store.pulsing.linear_pulse_function` now uses ``fmod`` to
  allow periodic voltage signals. The unit test for the pulsing function was
  updated accordingly.

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (git hash ``f0c0791``) into memaster.
- Relaxed tolerance for emission tests due to recent failures (the reason for
  the failures are unknown).

**Bugfixes**:

- Fixed bug in :func:`mewarpx.runinfo.RunInfo._check_voltages_wfs` to correctly
  parse an expression for the voltage on a conductor.
"
2.0.1, 1, 11/08/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (release 21.11) into memaster.
"
2.0.0, 1, 11/04/2021, "

**API Changes**:

- Renamed `mepicmi` to `mespecies`.
- Removed ``V_anode`` as input argument to
  :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.init_timestep`.
- :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.init_grid` now accepts boundary conditions
  as input.
- :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.init_grid` input argument ``max_grid_size``
  has been renamed to the more appropriate ``min_tiles``, and the default value
  changed from 4 to 1.
- Removed argument `write_dir` from checkpoint diagnostic.
- Argument ``max_steps`` in :class:`mewarpx.sim_control.SimControl` was changed
  to ``total_steps``.

**Other changes**:

- :class:`mewarpx.emission.ThermionicInjector` will now use the temperature
  and work-function of the conductor if those values are not directly given.

**Bugfixes**:

- In :func:`mewarpx.mwxrun.MEWarpXRun.step` the value of
  ``self.simulation.max_steps`` is no longer used, but instead the function
  relies on ``sim_control`` entirely.
- When attempting to restart the simulation it will not restart from a
  checkpoint file dumped at step 0.
"
1.0.0, 1, 11/03/2021, "

**Physics changes**:

- The flux history will now be loaded when restarting a run from a checkpoint
  file, so that the ``fullhist_dict`` accurately reflects the flux recorded
  over the full simulation span.

**API Changes**:

- Removed argument `write_dir` from diagnostics. Instead class variables are
  used for each type of diagnostic to specify the directory where data and
  plot files will be saved.
- :class:`mewarpx.diags_store.flux_diagnostic.FluxDiagFromFile` no longer takes
  runinfo parameters as input since the pickle files saved
  by :func:`mewarpx.diags_store.flux_diagnostic.FluxDiagBase.save` now contain
  all the information needed to reconstruct the flux diagnostic from file.

**Other changes**:

- :class:`mewarpx.diags_store.flux_diagnostic.FluxDiagBase` now also saves the
  list of species names included in the simulation and a dictionary of
  components and their labels, in the flux diagnostic pickle file. This allows
  flux diagnostics to be reloaded without loading a runinfo file.

0.2.1, 0, 11/02/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- Merge ``upstream/development`` (release 21.11) into memaster.
"
0.2.0, 0, 10/28/2021, "

**Features**:

- Allow multiple embedded boundaries to be installed in the simulation.

**Other changes**:

- The time-dependent voltage pulse function generated with
  :func:`mewarpx.util_store.pulsing.linear_pulse_function` was changed to no
  longer use variables in the expression. This is in order to be able to nest
  the voltage functions in ``if`` statements when multiple EBs are present.
"
0.1.1, 0,  10/26/2021, "

**Other changes**:

- :func:`mewarpx.utils_store.util.check_version` for scripts to define what
  version they use.
"
0.1.0, 0,  10/25/2021, "
