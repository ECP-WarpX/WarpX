The examples in this directory are based on the benchmark cases from Turner et
al. (Phys. Plasmas 20, 013507, 2013). Input files for all four cases are given
as well as an input file for a shortened simulation used in testing the MCC
functionality.
See the 'Examples' section in the documentation for previously computed
comparisons between WarpX and the literature results.
