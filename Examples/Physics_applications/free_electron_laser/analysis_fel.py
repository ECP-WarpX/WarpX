"""
This script tests that the FEL is correctly modelled in the simulation.

The physical parameters are the same as the ones from section 5.1
of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13645

The simulation uses the boosted-frame technique as described in
https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/940581
In particular, the effect of space-charge is effectively turned off
by initializing an electron and positron beam on top of each other,
each having half the current of the physical beam.

The script checks that the radiation wavelength and gain length
are the expected ones. The check is performed both in the
lab-frame diagnostics and boosted-frame diagnostics.
