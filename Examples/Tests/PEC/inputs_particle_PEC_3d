# Set-up to test PEC boundary condition with particles.
# A proton and negatively charged particle with equal mass as a proton are initialized
# near the boundary. The proton is given a finite bulk velocity in y and the negatively
# charged particle is stationary, initially. Due to the PEC boundary setting zero Ey
# tangential to the PEC surface at x_min and x_max, the Ey field gathered by the particles
# is two orders of magnitude smaller than the periodic boundary.
