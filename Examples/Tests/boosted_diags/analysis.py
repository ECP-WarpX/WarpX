'''
Analysis script of a WarpX simulation in a boosted frame.

The simulation runs in a boosted frame, and the analysis is done in the lab
frame, i.e., on the back-transformed diagnostics for the full 3D simulation and
an x-z slice at y=y_center. The field-data, Ez, along z, at (x_center,y_center,:) is compared
between the full back-transformed diagnostic and the reduced diagnostic (i.e., x-z slice) .
