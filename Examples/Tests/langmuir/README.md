# Examples of Langmuir oscillations in a uniform plasma in 1D, 2D, 3D, and RZ

In each case, a uniform plasma is setup with a sinusoidal perturbation in the
electron momentum along each axis. The plasma is followed for a short period
of time, long enough so that E fields develop. The resulting fields can be
compared to the analytic solutions.
