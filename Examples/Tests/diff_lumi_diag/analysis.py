# This test checks the differential luminosity of the beam-beam interaction
# in the case of two Gaussian beams crossing rigidly at the interaction point.
# The beams have a Gaussian distribution both in energy and in transverse positions.
# In that case, the differential luminosity can be calculated analytically.
