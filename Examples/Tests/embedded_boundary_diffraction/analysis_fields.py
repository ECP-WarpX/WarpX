"""
This test checks the implementation of the embedded boundary in cylindrical geometry,
by checking the diffraction of a laser by an embedded boundary here.
We then check that the first minimum of the diffracted intensity pattern
occurs along the angle given by the theoretical Airy pattern, i.e.
theta_diffraction = 1.22 * lambda / d
