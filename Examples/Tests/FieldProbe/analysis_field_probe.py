"""
This script tests the accuracy of the FieldProbe diagnostic by observing a plane
wave undergoing single slit diffraction. The input file inputs_2d is used. This
file defines the simulation box, laser pulse, embeded boundary with single slit,
and line of detector points. The plane wave initializes near the negative Z end
of the simulation box. The wave interacts with the embeded boundary at Z=0. The
wave undergoes diffraction at the slit. The electromagnetic flux is calculated
at the line detector which is placed perpendicular to Z beyond the slit. This
test will check if the detected EM flux matches expected values,
which can be solved analytically.
