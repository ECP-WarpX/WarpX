# This script tests the conservation of energy for a thermal plasma with periodic boundary.
# Here, we use energy-converving gather and an electrostatic solver. The energy
# is not expected to be exactly conserved, but it is expected to be better conserved
# than other gathering scheme. This tests checks that the energy does not increase by
# more than 0.3% over the duration of the simulatoin.
