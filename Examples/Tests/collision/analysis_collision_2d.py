# This script tests the collision module
# using electron-ion temperature relaxation in 2D.
# Initially, electrons and ions are both in equilibrium
# (gaussian) distributions, but have different temperatures.
# Relaxation occurs to bring the two temperatures to the
# same final temperature through collisions.
# The code was tested to be valid, more detailed results
# were used to obtain an exponential fit with
# coefficients a and b.
# This automated test compares the results with the fit.
# Unrelated to the collision module, we also test the plotfile
# particle filter function in this analysis script.

# Possible errors:
# tolerance: 0.001
# Possible running time: ~ 30.0 s
