# This script tests the collision module
# using electron-ion temperature relaxation in 2D.
# Initially, electrons and ions are both in equilibrium
# (gaussian) distributions, but have different temperatures.
# Relaxation occurs to bring the two temperatures to the
# same final temperature through collisions.
# The coefficients a and b of the exponential fit used to validate
# the test were obtained using the 'curve_fit' function (with initial guesses)
# imported from scipy.optimize on the data produced by running this test case.
# This automated test compares the results with the fit.
# Unrelated to the collision module, we also test the plotfile
# particle filter function in this analysis script.

# Possible errors:
# tolerance: 0.001
# Possible running time: ~ 30.0 s
