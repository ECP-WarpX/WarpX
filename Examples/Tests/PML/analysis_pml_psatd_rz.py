"""
This script tests the absorption of fields in the PML in RZ geometry.

The input file inputs_particle_rz is used: it features an electron
moving radially that launches a pulse. This scripts runs until
most of the pulse escapes the radial boundary. If the PML fails,
the pulse will remain with in the domain.
