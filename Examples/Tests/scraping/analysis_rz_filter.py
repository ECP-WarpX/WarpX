# This script tests the particle scraping for the embedded boundary in RZ.
# Particles are initialized between r=0.15 and r=0.2
# having a negative radial velocity.
# A cylindrical embedded surface is placed at r=0.1.
# Upon reaching the surface, particles should be removed.
# At the end of the simulation, i.e., at time step 37,
# there should be 512 particles left.
# This test checks that plot_filter_fucntion works with the boundary scraping diagnostic
# by making sure that the particles removed from only half the domain (z>0) have been recorded.

# Possible errors: 0
# tolerance: 0
# Possible running time: < 1 s
