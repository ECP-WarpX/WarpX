Ion Beam R Instability
======================

In this example a low density ion beam interacts with a "core" plasma population which induces an instability.
Based on the relative density between the beam and the core plasma a resonant or non-resonant condition can
be accessed.

Run
---

The same input script can be used for 1d, 2d or 3d simulations as well as
replicating either the resonant or non-resonant condition as indicated below.

.. dropdown:: Script ``PICMI_inputs.py``

   .. literalinclude:: PICMI_inputs.py
      :language: python3
      :caption: You can copy this file from ``Examples/Tests/ohm_solver_ion_beam_instability/PICMI_inputs.py``.

For `MPI-parallel <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`__ runs, prefix these lines with ``mpiexec -n 4 ...`` or ``srun -n 4 ...``, depending on the system.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Resonant case

      Execute:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 PICMI_inputs.py -dim {1/2/3} --resonant

   .. tab-item:: Non-resonant case

      Execute:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 PICMI_inputs.py -dim {1/2/3}

Analyze
-------

The following script reads the simulation output from the above example, performs
Fourier transforms of the field data and outputs the figures shown below.

.. dropdown:: Script ``analysis.py``

   .. literalinclude:: analysis.py
      :language: python3
      :caption: You can copy this file from ``Examples/Tests/ohm_solver_ion_beam_instability/analysis.py``.

The figures below show the evolution of the y-component of the magnetic field as the beam and
core plasma interact.

   Evolution of :math:`B_y` for resonant (top) and non-resonant (bottom) conditions.

The growth rates of the strongest growing modes for the resonant case are compared
to theory (dashed lines) in the figure below.

   Time series of the mode amplitudes for m = 4, 5, 6 from simulation. The
   theoretical growth for these modes are also shown as dashed lines.
