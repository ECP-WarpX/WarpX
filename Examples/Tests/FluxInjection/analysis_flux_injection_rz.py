"""
This script tests the continuous injection of particles in
the azimuthal direction, in RZ geometry.

In this tests, relativistic electrons are continuously injected
in a uniform Bz field, at a radius that corresponds to their
Larmor radius. Therefore, throughout the simulations, these
electrons always stay at the same radius, while gyrating
around the z axis.

This script tests that:
- At the end of the simulation, the electrons are all at
  the correct radius. (This indirectly checks that the
  electrons were injected with the correct velocity
  throughout the simulation, and in particular that this
  velocity was along the azimuthal direction.)
- The total number of electrons corresponds to the expected flux.
