# Self-Review a Pull Request

Review the changes on the current branch relative to the `development` branch, as if you were a WarpX maintainer reviewing a pull request.
This is a first pass that helps the author catch issues before requesting a review from other WarpX developers.
It does not replace the author's own critical review.

For best results, this skill should be run in a *fresh* session (not the one that wrote the code).
If this session also wrote the code under review, say so up front and weigh your own prior choices skeptically.
The author should commit their work and make sure their branch is up to date with `development`, so the diff the assistant reviews matches what reviewers will see.

This is a static review only. Do not build the code or run tests; CI covers both once the pull request is open.

## Review procedure

Review the changes on the current branch relative to the `development` branch, as if you were a WarpX maintainer reviewing a pull request.
Report your findings first and do not make any changes yet.

**Hard constraint:** perform only static inspection.
Do not configure, build, install, or execute project code, and do not run tests, analysis scripts, examples, benchmarks, linters, or timing commands.
In particular, do not use `cmake`, a compiler, `pip install`, `ctest`, or `pytest`, and do not use an existing build.
Assess test coverage, portability, and likely runtime from the source alone.
This constraint overrides the `Build Commands` and `Testing` sections of `AGENTS.md` for this review.

Start by reading AGENTS.md for the project conventions (style, portability, dimensionality, backward compatibility), then identify the remote that points at github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx with `git remote -v` (the WarpX contributing guide names it `mainline`; it may also be `origin` or `upstream`).
Call it <upstream>, then run `git fetch <upstream> development` followed by `git diff <upstream>/development...HEAD` to see the changes.
Fetching first ensures the diff is taken against the latest upstream `development`, not a stale local copy.

To learn the intended purpose of the changes, read the branch's commit messages (`git log <upstream>/development..HEAD`), and `gh pr view` if a pull request is already open.
Use the diff to locate the changes, then read the full changed files around each hunk before judging them: three lines of diff context is rarely enough to judge correctness.

When a finding depends on AMReX behavior, ground it in real source rather than recalling it from memory, and read that source at the commit pinned as `commit_amrex` in `dependencies.json`, which is the AMReX version that CI builds against.
Reading the pin costs nothing: a clone next to your WarpX checkout can show any file at that commit without touching your working tree or branches, and `raw.githubusercontent.com` serves it without a clone at all.
Either way works, and the second needs no clone:

- `git -C ../amrex show <pin>:Src/...`, if that clone exists and has the   commit (run `git -C ../amrex fetch origin` if it does not).
  Keep it read-only: never check out, switch, or pull in that clone, since it   may hold my own work.
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex/<pin>/Src/...`, which serves any file at that exact commit.

Do not judge whether the code compiles against the pin: CI does that with `-Werror`.
If you cannot reach AMReX source at the pin, fall back to the AMReX documentation and mark the finding as unverified.

Check the following and report concrete issues with file and line references:

1. Correctness: logic errors, off-by-one/index mistakes, uninitialized    values, incorrect physics or units, wrong sign conventions.
2. Algorithmic scaling: flag book-keeping or data-structure logic with worse asymptotic complexity than necessary, e.g., an O(N^2) loop over lists where an O(N) or O(N log N) approach exists.
3. Dimensionality: does the code handle all relevant builds (1D, 2D, 3D, RZ) correctly, including the compile-time macros?
4. GPU/CPU portability: any particle-to-grid deposition, scatter-add, histogram, or shared-counter loop must use `amrex::For` (not `amrex::ParallelFor`).
   Flag atomics that do not actually make a `ParallelFor` safe.
   See Docs/source/developers/portability.rst.
5. AMReX usage: is this the right AMReX abstraction, or does it hand-roll something AMReX already provides?
   Flag misuse that would still compile, e.g., wrong ghost-cell or index-type conventions.
6. Backward compatibility: if a user-facing input parameter was removed or renamed, is there a guard in the relevant BackwardCompatibility()?
7. Testing: is there a test covering the new feature?
   From static inspection alone, are its input size and apparent cost plausibly suitable for a 2-core CI runner?
   Never run or time it to answer these questions.
8. Style: does the diff follow the C++/Python style in AGENTS.md, and does it avoid reformatting unrelated code?
9. Auto-generated files: flag any manual edits to `.pyi` stubs, `dependencies.json`, or `Regression/Checksum/benchmarks_json/*.json`.
10. Documentation: are new user-facing parameters or features documented?
11. Scope: is anything unrelated to the stated purpose of the PR included?

For each finding, state the severity (blocking / should-fix / nit) and suggest a concrete fix.
End with a short summary of whether this PR looks ready for human review.

## Presenting the findings

Treat the output as a checklist of things the author should verify themselves, not as a verdict: it may raise false positives or miss real problems.
Confirm each finding against the code before acting on it.
