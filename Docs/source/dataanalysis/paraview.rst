3D Visualization: ParaView
==========================

WarpX results can be visualized by ParaView, an open source visualization and analysis software.
ParaView can be downloaded and installed from httpshttps://www.paraview.org.
Use the latest version for best results.

Tutorials
---------

ParaView is a powerful, general parallel rendering program.
If this is your first time using ParaView, consider starting with a tutorial.

openPMD
-------

WarpX' openPMD files can be visualized with ParaView 5.9+.
ParaView supports ADIOS1, ADIOS2 and HDF5 files, as it implements (like WarpX) against `openPMD-api <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api>`__.

For openPMD output, WarpX automatically creates an ``.pmd`` file per diagnostics, which can be opened with ParaView.

.. tip::

   When you first open ParaView, adjust its global ``Settings`` (Linux: under menu item ``Edit``).
   ``General`` -> ``Advanced`` -> Search for ``data`` -> ``Data Processing Options``.
   Check the box ``Auto Convert Properties``.

   This will simplify application of filters, e.g., contouring of components of vector fields, without first adding a calculator that extracts a single component or magnitude.

.. warning::

   `WarpX issue 21162 <https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX/issues/1803>`__:
   We currently load WarpX field data with a rotation.
   Please apply rotation of ``0 -90 0`` to mesh data.

.. warning::

   `ParaView issue 21837 <https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/-/issues/21837>`__:
   In order to visualize particle traces with the ``Temporal Particles To Pathlines``, you need to apply the ``Merge Blocks`` filter first.

   If you have multiple species, you may have to extract the species you want with ``Extract Block`` before applying ``Merge Blocks``.



Plotfiles (AMReX)
-----------------

ParaView also supports visualizing AMReX plotfiles.
Please see `the AMReX documentation <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Visualization.html#paraview>`__ for more details.
