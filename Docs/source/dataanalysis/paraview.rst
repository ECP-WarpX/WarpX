openPMD
-------

WarpX' openPMD files can be visualized with ParaView 5.9+.
ParaView supports ADIOS1, ADIOS2 and HDF5 files, as it implements (liked WarpX) against `openPMD-api <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api>`__.

For openPMD output, WarpX automatically creates an ``.pmd`` file per diagnostics, which can be opened with ParaView.

Plotfiles (AMReX)

*TODO* (cross-ref AMReX capabilities)
