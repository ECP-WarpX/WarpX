WarpX documentation
===================

WarpX is an advanced **electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell** code.

It supports many features including:

    - Perfectly-Matched Layers (PML)
    - Boosted-frame simulations
    - Mesh refinement

For details on the algorithms that WarpX implements, see the section :doc:`theory/theory`.

In addition, WarpX is a highly-parallel and highly-optimized code
which can run on GPUs and multi-core CPUs, and includes load balancing
capabilities.
