WarpX
-----

WarpX is an advanced **electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell** code.

It supports many features including:

    - Perfectly-Matched Layers (PML)
    - Boosted-frame simulations
    - Mesh refinement

For details on the algorithms that WarpX implements, see the :ref:`theory section <theory>`.

WarpX is a *highly-parallel and highly-optimized code*, which can run on GPUs and multi-core CPUs, and includes load balancing capabilities.
In addition, WarpX is also a *multi-platform code* and runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.
