Build from Source
=================

`CMake <https://cmake.org>`__ is our primary build system.
If you are new to CMake, we recommend starting with `this concise tutorial <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/>`__ from the HEP Software Foundation.
For those primarily interested in building the project, focus on these key sections: `1. Introduction <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/01-intro/index.html>`__, `2. Building with CMake <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/02-building/index.html>`__, and `9. Finding Packages <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/09-findingpackages/index.html>`__.

.. _install-build-dependencies:

Install Dependencies
--------------------

To begin, obtain a copy of the WarpX source code:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx.git $HOME/src/warpx
   cd $HOME/src/warpx

WarpX relies on :ref:`widely-used third-party software <install-dependencies>`.
Below, you'll find instructions for installing these dependencies using various package managers.
To ensure compatibility, pick **one** package manager for your development workflows.

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   dependencies


Install with conda-forge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conda provides a convenient way to install dependencies across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

`conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/download/>`__ is a community-led collection of recipes, build infrastructure and distributions for the conda package manager, offering cross-platform compatibility at the user level.

.. tip::

   We recommend to deactivate that conda self-activates its ``base`` environment.
   This `avoids interference with the system and other package managers <https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/WorkshopResources/WhitePapers/huebl-working-with-multiple-pkg-mgrs.pdf>`__.

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda config --set auto_activate_base false

   In order to make sure that the conda configuration uses ``conda-forge`` as the only channel, which will help avoid issues with blocked ``defaults`` or ``anaconda`` repositories, please set the following configurations:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda config --add channels conda-forge
      conda config --set channel_priority strict

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: With MPI (only Linux/macOS)

      .. code-block:: bash

         conda create -n warpx-cpu-mpich-dev -c conda-forge blaspp boost ccache cmake compilers git lapackpp "openpmd-api=*=mpi_mpich*" openpmd-viewer packaging pytest python python-build make numpy pandas scipy setuptools yt "fftw=*=mpi_mpich*" pkg-config matplotlib mamba mpich mpi4py ninja pip virtualenv wheel
         conda activate warpx-cpu-mpich-dev

         # compile WarpX with -DWarpX_MPI=ON
         # for pip, use: export WARPX_MPI=ON

   .. tab-item:: Without MPI

      .. code-block:: bash

         conda create -n warpx-cpu-dev -c conda-forge blaspp boost ccache cmake compilers git lapackpp openpmd-api openpmd-viewer packaging pytest python python-build make numpy pandas scipy setuptools yt fftw pkg-config matplotlib mamba ninja pip virtualenv wheel
         conda activate warpx-cpu-dev

         # compile WarpX with -DWarpX_MPI=OFF
         # for pip, use: export WARPX_MPI=OFF

For OpenMP support, you will further need:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      .. code-block:: bash

         mamba install -c conda-forge libgomp

   .. tab-item:: macOS or Windows

      .. code-block:: bash

         mamba install -c conda-forge llvm-openmp

For Nvidia CUDA GPU support, you will need to have `a recent CUDA driver installed <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__ or you can lower the CUDA version of `the Nvidia cuda package <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#conda-installation>`__ and `conda-forge to match your drivers <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#install-cupy-from-conda-forge>`__ and then add these packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba install -c nvidia -c conda-forge cuda cuda-nvtx-dev cupy

More info for `CUDA-enabled ML packages <https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1697435241152127369>`__.


Install with Spack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spack provides another option for installing dependencies on Linux and macOS systems.

`Spack <https://spack.readthedocs.io>`__ is a flexible, user-level package manager designed primarily for Linux, with growing support for macOS and planned future support for Windows.

To begin, download a `WarpX Spack desktop development environment <https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx/blob/development/Tools/machines/desktop>`__ configuration.
For most desktop development work, we recommend using the OpenMP environment for CPUs, unless you have a supported GPU device.

* **Debian/Ubuntu** Linux:

  * OpenMP: ``system=ubuntu; compute=openmp`` (CPUs)
  * CUDA: ``system=ubuntu; compute=cuda`` (Nvidia GPUs)
  * ROCm: ``system=ubuntu; compute=rocm`` (AMD GPUs)
  * SYCL: *todo* (Intel GPUs)
* **macOS**: first, prepare with ``brew install gpg2; brew install gcc``

  * OpenMP: ``system=macos; compute=openmp``

If you already `installed Spack <https://spack.io>`__, we recommend to activate its `binary caches <https://spack.io/spack-binary-packages/>`__ for faster builds:

.. code-block:: bash

   spack mirror add rolling https://binaries.spack.io/develop
   spack buildcache keys --install --trust

Now install the WarpX dependencies in a new WarpX development environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   # download environment file
   curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx/development/Tools/machines/desktop/spack-${system}-${compute}.yaml

   # create new development environment
   spack env create warpx-${compute}-dev spack-${system}-${compute}.yaml
   spack env activate warpx-${compute}-dev

   # installation
   spack install
   python3 -m pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy openpmd-api openpmd-viewer pandas scipy virtualenv yt

In new terminal sessions, re-activate the environment with

.. code-block:: bash

   spack env activate warpx-openmp-dev

again.
Replace ``openmp`` with the equivalent you chose.

Compile WarpX with ``-DWarpX_MPI=ON``.
For ``pip``, use ``export WARPX_MPI=ON``.


Install with Brew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Brew can be used to install dependencies on Linux and macOS.

`Homebrew (Brew) <https://brew.sh>`__ is a user-level package manager primarily for `Apple macOS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS>`__, but also supports Linux.

.. code-block:: bash

   brew update
   brew tap openpmd/openpmd
   brew install adios2      # for openPMD
   brew install ccache
   brew install cmake
   brew install fftw        # for PSATD
   brew install git
   brew install hdf5-mpi    # for openPMD
   brew install libomp
   brew unlink gcc
   brew link --force libomp
   brew install pkg-config  # for fftw
   brew install open-mpi
   brew install openblas    # for PSATD in RZ
   brew install openpmd-api # for openPMD

If you also want to compile with PSATD in RZ, you need to manually install BLAS++ and LAPACK++:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
   sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/cmake-easyinstall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ax3l/cmake-easyinstall/main/cmake-easyinstall
   sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/cmake-easyinstall

   cmake-easyinstall --prefix=/usr/local git+https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/blaspp.git \
       -Duse_openmp=OFF -Dbuild_tests=OFF -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
   cmake-easyinstall --prefix=/usr/local git+https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/lapackpp.git \
       -Duse_cmake_find_lapack=ON -Dbuild_tests=OFF -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON

Compile WarpX with ``-DWarpX_MPI=ON``.
For ``pip``, use ``export WARPX_MPI=ON``.


Install with APT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Advanced Package Tool (APT) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)>`__ is a system-level package manager on Debian-based Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: With MPI (only Linux/macOS)

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo apt update
         sudo apt install build-essential ccache cmake g++ git libfftw3-mpi-dev libfftw3-dev libhdf5-openmpi-dev libopenmpi-dev pkg-config python3 python3-dev python3-matplotlib python3-mpi4py python3-numpy python3-pandas python3-pip python3-scipy python3-venv

         # optional:
         # for CUDA, either install
         #   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (preferred)
         # or, if your Debian/Ubuntu is new enough, use the packages
         #   sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-dev libcub-dev

         # compile WarpX with -DWarpX_MPI=ON
         # for pip, use: export WARPX_MPI=ON

   .. tab-item:: Without MPI

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo apt update
         sudo apt install build-essential ccache cmake g++ git libfftw3-dev libfftw3-dev libhdf5-dev pkg-config python3 python3-dev python3-matplotlib python3-numpy python3-pandas python3-pip python3-scipy python3-venv

         # optional:
         # for CUDA, either install
         #   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (preferred)
         # or, if your Debian/Ubuntu is new enough, use the packages
         #   sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-dev libcub-dev

         # compile WarpX with -DWarpX_MPI=OFF
         # for pip, use: export WARPX_MPI=OFF


.. _install-build-code:

Build the Code
--------------

.. _build-the-executable-with-cmake:

Build the Executable with CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build WarpX from the source directory, execute these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Configure the build system
   # Additional options available, such as:
   #   -DWarpX_PYTHON=ON
   #   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/sw/warpx
   cmake -S . -B build

   # Compile using four parallel threads
   cmake --build build -j 4

**That's it!**
The 3D WarpX binary is now available in ``build/bin/`` and is ready to :ref:`run <usage_run>` with any :ref:`3D example input file <usage-examples>`.
You can either run the binary directly from this location or copy it to another directory.

For a system-wide installation, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   # for default install paths, you will need administrator rights, e.g. with sudo:
   cmake --build build --target install

You can inspect and modify build options after running ``cmake -S . -B build`` with either

.. code-block:: bash

   ccmake build

or by adding arguments with ``-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>`` to the first CMake call.
For example, this builds WarpX in all geometries, enables Python bindings and Nvidia GPU (CUDA) support:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S . -B build -DWarpX_DIMS="1;2;3;RZ;RCYLINDER;RSPHERE" -DWarpX_COMPUTE=CUDA

On a machine without a visible GPU, e.g. an HPC login node, additionally select the GPU architecture to compile for (see :ref:`building-cmake-gpu-archs`).


An executable WarpX binary with the current compile-time options encoded in its file name will be created in ``build/bin/``.
Note that you need separate binaries to run 1D, 2D, 3D, RZ, RCYLINDER, RSPHERE geometry inputs scripts.
Additionally, a `symbolic link <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link>`__ named ``warpx`` can be found in that directory, which points to the last built WarpX executable.

More details on running simulations are in the section :ref:`Run WarpX <usage_run>`.
Alternatively, read on and also build our PICMI Python interface.

.. _install-build-python-cmake:

Build the Python Interface with CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   First, ensure your Python development environment is up-to-date:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m pip install -U pip
      python3 -m pip install -U build packaging setuptools[core] wheel
      python3 -m pip install -U cmake
      python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

To build the PICMI Python bindings, configure WarpX to generate a library and install it using our ``pip_install`` *CMake target*:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Configure with all WarpX dimensionalities and Python support enabled
   cmake -S . -B build_py -DWarpX_DIMS="1;2;3;RZ;RCYLINDER;RSPHERE" -DWarpX_PYTHON=ON

   # Build and install the Python package
   cmake --build build_py --target pip_install -j 4

**That's it!**
You can now :ref:`run a first 3D PICMI script <usage-picmi>` from our :ref:`examples <usage-examples>`.

Developers could now change the WarpX source code and then call the build line again to refresh the Python installation.

.. tip::

   If you do *not* develop with :ref:`a user-level package manager <install-dependencies>`, e.g., because you rely on a HPC system's environment modules, then consider to set up a virtual environment via `Python venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__.
   Otherwise, without a virtual environment, you likely need to add the CMake option ``-DPY_PIP_INSTALL_OPTIONS="--user"``.


.. _install-build-python-pip:

Build the Python Interface with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is relevant for Python package management, mainly for maintainers or people that rather like to interact only with ``pip``.

One can build and install ``pywarpx`` from the root of the WarpX source tree:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip wheel -v .
   python3 -m pip install pywarpx*whl

This will call the CMake logic above implicitly.
Using this workflow has the advantage that it can build and package up multiple libraries with varying ``WarpX_DIMS`` into one ``pywarpx`` package.


.. _install-build-options:

Build Options
-------------

Configure your Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use a specific compiler instead of the system default, set the appropriate environment variables.
For instance, to use Clang/LLVM:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CC=$(which clang)
   export CXX=$(which clang++)

For CUDA development, specify both the CUDA compiler and the host C++ compiler:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CUDACXX=$(which nvcc)
   export CUDAHOSTCXX=$(which clang++)

We also support adding `additional compiler flags via environment variables <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#cmake-language-environment-variables>`__ such as `CXXFLAGS <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CXXFLAGS.html>`__/`LDFLAGS <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/LDFLAGS.html>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

   # example: treat all compiler warnings as errors
   export CXXFLAGS="-Werror"

.. note::

   Please clean your build directory with ``rm -rf build/`` after changing the compiler.
   Now call ``cmake -S . -B build`` (+ further options) again to re-initialize the build configuration.


.. _building-cmake-gpu-archs:

Select GPU Architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Nvidia GPUs, WarpX uses the standard CMake interface to select the CUDA architectures to compile for.
By default, we select ``native``, i.e., CMake detects the architecture of the GPU(s) visible on the machine that runs ``cmake`` and WarpX is built exactly for those.

If no GPU is visible at configuration time (a typical situation on HPC login nodes, in containers and in CI) then configuration stops with an error and you need to select the architecture explicitly, either as a CMake option:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S . -B build -DWarpX_COMPUTE=CUDA -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80

or as an `environment variable <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CUDAARCHS.html>`__, which is what our :ref:`HPC profiles <install-hpc>` do:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CUDAARCHS=80

Architectures are written as integers, e.g., ``80`` for A100 (compute capability 8.0) and ``90`` for H100.
`Multiple architectures <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/CUDA_ARCHITECTURES.html>`__ are separated by semicolons (``"80;90"``), and the special values ``native``, ``all`` and ``all-major`` are supported as well.

.. note::

   The older AMReX-specific spellings ``-DAMReX_CUDA_ARCH=8.0`` and ``export AMREX_CUDA_ARCH=8.0`` still work, but are deprecated and warn.
   They are translated to the CMake variables above, including their historical value formats (``Auto``, ``Common``, ``Volta``, ``8.0``, ``7.0+PTX``, whitespace-separated lists).

For AMD GPUs, select the architecture with ``-DAMReX_AMD_ARCH=gfx90a`` or ``export AMREX_AMD_ARCH=gfx90a``.

WarpX can be configured in further detail with options from AMReX, which are documented in the AMReX manual:

* `general AMReX build options <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/BuildingAMReX.html#customization-options>`__
* `GPU-specific options <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/GPU.html#building-gpu-support>`__.

**Developers** might be interested in additional options that control dependencies of WarpX.
By default, the most important dependencies of WarpX are automatically downloaded for convenience:

For example, one can also build against a local AMReX copy.
Assuming AMReX' source is located in ``$HOME/src/amrex``, add the ``cmake`` argument ``-DWarpX_amrex_src=$HOME/src/amrex``.
Relative paths are also supported, e.g. ``-DWarpX_amrex_src=../amrex``.

Or build against an AMReX feature branch of a colleague.
Assuming your colleague pushed AMReX to ``https://github.com/WeiqunZhang/amrex/`` in a branch ``new-feature`` then pass to ``cmake`` the arguments: ``-DWarpX_amrex_repo=https://github.com/WeiqunZhang/amrex.git -DWarpX_amrex_branch=new-feature``.
More details on this :ref:`workflow are described here <developers-local-compile-src>`.

You can speed up the install further if you pre-install these dependencies, e.g. with a package manager.
Set ``-DWarpX_<dependency-name>_internal=OFF`` and add installation prefix of the dependency to the environment variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html>`__.
Please see the :ref:`introduction to CMake <install-build-cmake>` if this sounds new to you.
More details on this :ref:`workflow are described here <developers-local-compile-findpackage>`.

If you re-compile often, consider installing the `Ninja <https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages>`__ build system.
Pass ``-G Ninja`` to the CMake configuration call to speed up parallel compiles.

============================= ============================================ ================================================================

Note that we currently change the ``WARPX_MPI`` default intentionally to ``OFF``, to simplify a first install from source.

Some hints and workflows follow.
Developers, that want to test a change of the source code but did not change the ``pywarpx`` version number, can force a reinstall via:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -v .

Some Developers like to code directly against a local copy of AMReX, changing both code-bases at a time:

.. code-block:: bash

   WARPX_AMREX_SRC=$PWD/../amrex python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -v .

Additional environment control as common for CMake (:ref:`see above <install-build-cmake>`) can be set as well, e.g. ``CC``, `CXX``, and ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` hints.
So another sophisticated example might be: use Clang as the compiler, build with local source copies of PICSAR and AMReX, support the FFT-based solvers, MPI and openPMD, hint a parallel HDF5 installation in ``$HOME/sw/hdf5-parallel-1.10.4``, and only build 2D and 3D geometry:

.. code-block:: bash

   CC=$(which clang) CXX=$(which clang++) WARPX_AMREX_SRC=$PWD/../amrex WARPX_PICSAR_SRC=$PWD/../picsar WARPX_FFT=ON WARPX_MPI=ON WARPX_DIMS="2;3" CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/sw/hdf5-parallel-1.10.4:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -v .

Here we wrote this all in one line, but one can also set all environment variables in a development environment and keep the pip call nice and short as in the beginning.
Note that you need to use absolute paths for external source trees, because pip builds in a temporary directory, e.g. ``export WARPX_AMREX_SRC=$HOME/src/amrex``.

All of this can also be run from CMake.
This is the workflow most developers will prefer as it allows rapid re-compiles:

.. code-block:: bash

   # build WarpX executables and libraries
   cmake -S . -B build_py -DWarpX_DIMS="1;2;3;RZ;RCYLINDER;RSPHERE" -DWarpX_PYTHON=ON

   # build & install Python only
   cmake --build build_py -j 4 --target pip_install

There is also a ``--target pip_install_nodeps`` option that :ref:`skips pip-based dependency checks <developers-local-compile-pylto>`.

WarpX release managers might also want to generate a self-contained source package that can be distributed to exotic architectures:

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py sdist --dist-dir .
   python3 -m pip wheel -v pywarpx-*.tar.gz
   python3 -m pip install *whl

The above steps can also be executed in one go to build from source on a machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 setup.py sdist --dist-dir .
   python3 -m pip install -v pywarpx-*.tar.gz

Last but not least, you can uninstall ``pywarpx`` as usual with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip uninstall pywarpx
