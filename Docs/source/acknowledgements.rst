Funding and Acknowledgements
============================

WarpX is supported by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations (Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration) responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem, including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering, and early testbed platforms, in support of the nation's exascale computing imperative.

CEA-LIDYL actively contributes to the co-development of WarpX.
As part of this initiative, WarpX also receives funding from the French National Research Agency (ANR - Plasm-On-Chip), the Horizon H2020 program and CEA.

We acknowledge all the contributors and users of the WarpX community who participate to the code quality with valuable code improvement and important feedback.
