CEA-LIDYL actively contributes to the co-development of WarpX.
As part of this initiative, WarpX also receives funding from the French National Research Agency (ANR - Plasm-On-Chip), the Horizon H2020 program and CEA.

WarpX was supported by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations (Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration) responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem, including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering, and early testbed platforms, in support of the nation's exascale computing imperative.

ABLASTR seed development was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

We acknowledge all the contributors and users of the WarpX community who participate to the code quality with valuable code improvement and important feedback.
