    abstract = "{Parallel intense laser beam ω0, k0 and ω1, k1 shone on a plasma with frequency separation equal to the plasma frequency ωp is capable of creating a coherent large electrostatic field and accelerating particles to high energies in large flux. The photon beam excites through the forward Raman scattering large amplitude plasmons whose phase velocity is equal to (ω−ω1)/(k0−k1), close to c in an underdense plasma. The plasmon traps electrons with electrostatic field EL=γ1/2⊥ mcωp/c, of the order of a few GeV/cm for plasma density to 1018 cm−3. Because of the phase velocity of the field close to c this field carries trapped electrons to high energies: W=2mc2(ω0/ωp)2. Preaccelerated particles (ions, for examples) coherent with the plasmon fields can also be accelerated. The (multiple) forward Raman instability saturates only when a sizable electron population is trapped and most of the electromagnetic energy is cascaded down to the frequency close to the cut‐off (ωp).}",

abstract = "{We present the first hybrid simulations with kinetic ions and recently developed equations of state for the electron fluid appropriate for reconnection with a guide field. The equations of state account for the main anisotropy of the electron pressure tensor. Magnetic reconnection is studied in two systems, an initially force-free current sheet and a Harris sheet. The hybrid model with the equations of state is compared to two other models, hybrid simulations with isothermal electrons and fully kinetic simulations. Including the anisotropic equations of state in the hybrid model provides a better match to the fully kinetic model. In agreement with fully kinetic results, the main feature captured is the formation of an electron current sheet that extends several ion inertial lengths. This electron current sheet modifies the Hall magnetic field structure near the X-line, and it is not observed in the standard hybrid model with isotropic electrons. The saturated reconnection rate in this regime nevertheless remains similar in all three models. Implications for global modeling are discussed.}",

In solid target experiments with focused intensities exceeding 1020 W/cm2, high-energy electron generation, hard bremsstrahlung, and energetic protons have been observed on the backside of the target. In this report, an attempt is made to explain the physical process present that will explain the presence of these energetic protons, as well as explain the number, energy, and angular spread of the protons observed in experiment. In particular, we hypothesize that hot electrons produced on the front of the target are sent through to the back off the target, where they ionize the hydrogen layer there. These ions are then accelerated by the hot electron cloud, to tens of MeV energies in distances of order tens of μm, whereupon they end up being detected in the radiographic and spectrographic detectors.}",

A detailed study of their performance in the near-field of the laser beam is presented, a setup relevant to improving the pulse contrast of modern ultrahigh power lasers (TW–PW). The conditions under which high reflectivity can be achieved and focusability of the reflected beam retained are identified. At higher intensities a region of high specular reflectivity with rapidly decreasing focusability was observed, suggesting that specular reflectivity alone is not an adequate guide to the ideal range of plasma mirror operation. It was found that to achieve high reflectivity with negligible phasefront distortion of the reflected beam the inequality csΔt\\&lt;λLaser must be met (cs: sound speed, Δt: time from plasma formation to the peak of the pulse). The achievable contrast enhancement is given by the ratio of plasma mirror reflectivity to cold reflectivity.}",
