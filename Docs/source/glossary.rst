Glossary
========

In daily communication, we tend to abbreviate a lot of terms.
It is important to us to make it easy to interact with the WarpX community and thus, this list shall help to clarify often used terms.

Abbreviations
-------------

* **ES:** electrostatic, e.g. ES PIC
* **FDTD:** `Finite-difference time-domain or Yee's method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method>`__, a class of grid-based finite-difference field solvers
* **GPU:** originally graphics processing unit, now used for fast `general purpose computing (GPGPU) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit#Stream_processing_and_general_purpose_GPUs_(GPGPU)>`__; also called (hardware) accelerator
* **LPA:** laser-plasma acceleration, historically used for laser-electron acceleration
* **LPI:** laser-plasma interaction
* **LWFA:** laser-wakefield acceleration (of electrons/leptons)
* **MR:** mesh-refinement
* **MVA:** magnetic-vortex acceleration (of protons/ions)
* **NERSC:** `National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center <https://www.nersc.gov/>`__, a supercomputing center located in Berkeley, CA (USA)
