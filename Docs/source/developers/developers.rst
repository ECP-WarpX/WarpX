   A tutorial-style overview of the code structure can also be found in a `developer presentation from 03/2020 <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_JVm6Nprxz9_rk1YO2-zO0b0T96v4aWC>`__.
   It contains information about the code structure, a step-by-step description of what happens in a simulation (initialization and iterations) as well as slides on topics relevant to WarpX development.

   Information in the following pages are generally more up-to-date, but the slides above might still be useful.
