Developers documentation
========================

For general information on how to contribute to WarpX, including our ``git`` workflow and code practices, have a look at our `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__!

A general overview of the code structure can be found in the `WarpX tutorial presentation <../_static/WarpX_tutorial.pdf>`_. It contains information about the code structure, a step-by-step description of what happens in a simulation (initialization and iterations) as well as slides on topics relevant to WarpX development.

Our Doxygen API documentation in classic formatting `is located here <../_static/doxyhtml/index.html>`_.
