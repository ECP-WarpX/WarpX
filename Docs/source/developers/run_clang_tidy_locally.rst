The clang-tidy linter
=====================

Clang-tidy CI test
------------------

WarpX's CI tests include several checks performed with the
`clang-tidy <https://releases.llvm.org/15.0.0/tools/clang/tools/extra/docs/clang-tidy/index.html>`__ linter
(currently the version 15 of this tool). The complete list of checks
enforced in CI tests can be found in the ``.clang-tidy`` configuration file.

Run clang-tidy linter locally
-----------------------------

We provide a script to run clang-tidy locally. The script can be run as follows.
Few optional environment variables can be set to tune the behavior of this script:

* ``WARPX_TOOLS_LINTER_PARALLEL``: sets the number of cores to be used for the compilation
* ``CLANG``, ``CLANGXX``, and ``CLANGTIDY`` : set the version of the compiler and of the linter

Note: clang v15 is currently used in CI tests. It is therefore recommended to use this version.
Otherwise, a newer version may find issues not currently covered by CI tests (checks are opt-in)
while older versions may not find all the issues.

.. code-block:: bash

   export WARPX_TOOLS_LINTER_PARALLEL=12
   export CLANG=clang-15
   export CLANGXX=clang++-15
   export CLANGTIDY=clang-tidy-15
   ./Tools/Linter/runClangTidy.sh
