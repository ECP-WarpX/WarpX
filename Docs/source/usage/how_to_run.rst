Run WarpX
=========

In order to run a new simulation:

#. create a **new directory**, where the simulation will be run
#. make sure the WarpX **executable** is either copied into this directory or in your ``PATH`` `environment variable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`__
#. add an **inputs file** and on :ref:`HPC systems <install-hpc>` a **submission script** to the directory
#. run

1. Run Directory
----------------

On Linux/macOS, this is as easy as this

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p <run_directory>

Where ``<run_directory>`` by the actual path to the run directory.

2. Executable
-------------

If you installed warpX with a :ref:`package manager <install-users>`, a ``warpx``-prefixed executable will be available as a regular system command to you.
Depending on the choosen build options, the name is suffixed with more details.
Try it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   warpx<TAB>

Hitting the ``<TAB>`` key will suggest available WarpX executables as found in your ``PATH`` `environment variable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`__.

.. note::

   WarpX needs separate binaries to run in dimensionality of 1D, 2D, 3D, and RZ.
   We encode the supported dimensionality in the binary file name.

If you :ref:`compiled the code yourself <install-developers>`, the WarpX executable is stored in the source folder under ``build/bin``.
We also create a symbolic link that is just called ``warpx`` that points to the last executable you built, which can be copied, too.
Copy the **executable** to this directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp build/bin/<warpx_executable> <run_directory>/

where ``<warpx_executable>`` should be replaced by the actual name of the executable (see above) and ``<run_directory>`` by the actual path to the run directory.

3. Inputs
---------

Add an **input file** in the directory (see :ref:`examples <usage-examples>` and :ref:`parameters <running-cpp-parameters>`).
This file contains the numerical and physical parameters that define the situation to be simulated.

On :ref:`HPC systems <install-hpc>`, also copy and adjust a submission script that allocated computing nodes for you.
Please :ref:`reach out to us <contact>` if you need help setting up a template that runs with ideal performance.

4. Run
------

**Run** the executable, e.g. with MPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd <run_directory>

   # run with an inputs file:
   mpirun -np <n_ranks> ./warpx <input_file>

or

.. code-block:: bash

   # run with a PICMI input script:
   mpirun -np <n_ranks> python <python_script>

Here, ``<n_ranks>`` is the number of MPI ranks used, and ``<input_file>`` is the name of the input file (``<python_script>`` is the name of the :ref:`PICMI <usage-picmi>` script).
Note that the actual executable might have a longer name, depending on build options.

We used the copied executable in the current directory (``./``); if you installed with a package manager, skip the ``./`` because WarpX is in your ``PATH``.

On an :ref:`HPC system <install-hpc>`, you would instead submit the :ref:`job script <install-hpc>` at this point, e.g. ``sbatch <submission_script>`` (SLURM on Cori/NERSC) or ``bsub <submission_script>`` (LSF on Summit/OLCF).

.. tip::

   In the :ref:`next sections <running-cpp-parameters>`, we will explain parameters of the ``<input_file>``.
   You can overwrite all parameters inside this file also from the command line, e.g.:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mpirun -np 4 ./warpx <input_file> max_step=10 warpx.numprocs=1 2 2
